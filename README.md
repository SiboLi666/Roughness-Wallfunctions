# Roughness-Wallfunctions

The RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes) models usually underpredict the convective heat flux because they consider the wall as smooth. In some circumstances, the wall can be quite rough, such as iced surface. Therefore, the thermall wall function derived by Lima Da Silva et al. has been implemented to study the roughness effect, in which the roughness effect is considered by using the momentum and heat transfer analogy factor.
